  <h1>Jonathan Cooper Leary</h1>
  <p>Im Jonathan Cooper Leary im 21 years old, and im a huge nerd. Love watching anime on my free time along with
    playing video games of almost any kind. At the moment i've been playing Monster Hunter World on my pc. I love the
    fact that i've moved to Idaho since i've always been a fan of snowboarding, but only really ever got to go and
    actually board rarely. Im super excited to learn code, and very glad that i've got my dad Phil to help with code im
    having issues understanding. First day of the school was super fun and im super excited to continue. </p>
